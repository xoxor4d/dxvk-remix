  /**
   * DLSS Neural Rendering (DLSS-NR) post pass.
   *
   * Runs after the upscaler --- after DLSS, DLSS-RR, XeSS, NIS, TAA-U or the plain copy that
   * stands in for them --- and enhances the already resolved image at output resolution.
   *
   * Three stages, because the snippet is a display referred image network and this pass sits
   * upstream of tone mapping where m_finalOutput is still unbounded linear radiance:
   *
   *   1. encode  --- compute, builds a soft clipped sRGB proxy of m_finalOutput
   *   2. evaluate --- the NGX feature, run on the proxy plus the render-res depth/motion guides
   *   3. decode  --- compute, carries the network's change back onto the untouched HDR
   *                  m_finalOutput and restores its original alpha channel
   *
   * Everything downstream (dust particles, bloom, motion blur, tonemapping, post FX, sRGB
   * dither) still sees unbounded linear HDR in m_finalOutput and is unaffected.
   *
   * The pass is modelled on DxvkRayReconstruction (rtx_ray_reconstruction.h:29) --- same
   * CommonDeviceObject + RtxPass base, same barrier shape around the NGX evaluate, same lazy
   * NGX context creation --- but it is not an upscaler and never participates in
   * RtxContext::getCurrentFrameUpscaler().
   *
   * It silently does nothing when nvngx_dlssnr.dll is not shipped beside the module.
