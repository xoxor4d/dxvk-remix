// as the DLFG thread may be quite a ways disconnected from where rendering work is being submitted such that occasionally 0 or 2 frames worth of
// work will fall in between the present markers here, which causes Reflex to generate long sleeps where it shouldn't, resulting in stutters.
// Additionally, this only really matters for the Present marker right now, the out-of-band Present marker can stay where it should be without causing issues.
// As such, until this Vulkan extension is used in our Reflex implementation the begin/end Presentation calls are moved from the DLFG thread to the submit
// thread as a hack when this workaround is enabled to ensure they are placed in a more suitable location that will always come after render queue submission.
