   * \brief DLSS-NR (Neural Uplift) image enhancement pass
   *
   * The DLSS 5 neural rendering feature, run as a post-process on a finished frame. It is not an
   * upscaler - input and output are the same resolution - so it sits downstream of whichever
   * upscaler produced the frame, enhancing it with the depth and motion vectors that upscaler
   * already consumed.
   *
   * Depth and motion vectors arrive at render resolution while the colour is at display
   * resolution; the snippet is told their real sizes through its per-buffer subrects rather than
   * having them resampled.
   *
   * The model is LDR-clamped and trained on tonemapped, display-encoded frames, so it has exactly
   * one valid anchor in this pipeline: after the sRGB pass, which is where the image acquires its
   * display encoding, and before the UI is composited. That is a correctness requirement rather
   * than a tuning choice, which is why it is not selectable.
